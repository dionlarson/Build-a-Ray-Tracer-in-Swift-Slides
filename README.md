# Build a Ray Caster / Tracer in Swift

This repository contains the slides explaining the concepts needed to build a ray caster/tracer in Swift. The skeleton code and instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/dionlarson/Ray-Tracer-Skeleton-Swift-OSX). Instructions will be updated weekly from now throughout the end of the class.

# Legal stuff

These slides are adapted from the MIT 6.837 lecture notes on OCW. Originally taught by Wojciech Matusik and Fr√©do Durand in Fall 2012.

All additional slides were written by Dion Larson unless noted otherwise.

The original 6.837 slides are available for free [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/lecture-notes/). We're focusing on lectures 11 through 18.

My adaptations of the slides will be hosted in this repository and updated from now throughout the end of the class.
